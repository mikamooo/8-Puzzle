## Compilation and Execution Instructions
###### Driver
Running the driver version allows you to enter your own puzzle to be solved by any of the three algorithms. The driver provides a debug mode, which prints the path taken by the chosen algorithm, and a quiet mode, which only prints the initial and final puzzle along with the total cost.

To compile, use the command: make driver
To execute, use the command: ./driver

###### Tester
Running the tester version uses the text file test_puzzles.txt to compare and print the expected results of the test cases to the calculated results.

To compile, use the command: make tester
To execute, use the command: ./tester
